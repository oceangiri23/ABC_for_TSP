            Hey there! üëã I'm <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Sagar Giri</span>,
            a Machine Learning Engineer and a final-year Computer Engineering student at IOE, Pulchowk Campus. 
            I am currently a Research Intern at NAAMI (Nepal Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research),
             where I explore advanced research topics. My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
             and multimodal systems.<br/>

            As a dedicated and motivated learner, I am interested about advancing AI and data technologies.
             I am committed to developing innovative development programs to drive progress and deliver impactful solutions in the 
             fields of AI/ML, with a strong focus on research-driven approaches to solving real-world applied AI challenges.<br/>

            Apart from my academic and professional pursuits, I am also an avid cook and enjoy preparing a wide variety of
             dishes, always looking to try new recipes and experiment with flavors.
